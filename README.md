# MapleMarket Contracts

maplemarket.xyz is in alpha stage, it only supports DeFi Kingdoms at the moment, and it's using [dfkearn contracts](https://github.com/dfk-earn/dfkearn-contracts). 

Future development: 
* Support ERC721/1155 (dfkearn only supports ERC20, since DFK Eggs are ERC20)
* Support dynamic cost unit (dfkearn set this fixed to Jewel) 
* support more order types: auction, P2P exchange
